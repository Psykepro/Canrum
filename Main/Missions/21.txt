Write a program that calculate the amount of money of saving for not printing on paper the exam descriptions. There
 are N students in the academy. The number of paper sheets that should be printed for each student is S.
 One realm (box with paper sheets) contains exactly 500 sheets of paper. The price of one realm is P.
You can buy part of a realm. For example if the price of a realm is 2.20 you can buy 0.45 parts of one realm which means
 that you will pay 0.45 * 2.20 = 0.99.
N, S, P should be read from the console. Output the exact total amount of money the trainers save for not printing
 the exams on paper. The output should be rounded with 2 digits after the decimal point.
See the examples below for clarification.%1100 54.80%52.80	
/Explanation/1100 students with 5 sheets of paper each = total 5500 sheets of paper.
5500 sheets of paper means 11 reams.
11 reams with price of 4.80 each = 52.80
