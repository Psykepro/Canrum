You are part of the back-end development team of the next Facebook. You are given a line of usernames,
between one of the following symbols: space, “/”, “\”, “(“, “)”. First you have to export all valid usernames.
A valid username starts with a letter and can contain only letters, digits and “_”. It cannot be less than 3 or
more than 25 symbols long. Your task is to sum the length of every 2 consecutive valid usernames and print
on the console the 2 valid usernames with biggest sum of their lengths, each on a separate line.
