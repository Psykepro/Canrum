Every mediocre programmer does not care about his code. He just finishes the job as quickly as possible, runs the project – if it works, he leaves it. This is an example of a bad, bad programmer (not to be confused with “bad, bad girl”). One who does not name his solutions, projects, files, classes, methods and variables in a correct meaningful and easy to read way. One who is sloppy, messy, lazy and not eager to gain new knowledge every single day. Remember that, folks, remember it from your good-intentioned trainers!
Your task is to create a program named “ConsoleApplication2” which solves the following task. You will receive N numbers from the input. You will have to select those who are in even positions (starting from zero) and calculate the product of their digits. If one of the digits is zero, ignore it in the calculations. If the number itself is zero, consider the product of its digits to be 1. Afterwards find the product of all previously found products as the final result.
Let’s make it more interesting. If the input numbers are more than 10, calculate the result from the formula above for the first 10 numbers and then calculate it again for all other numbers after the 10th. If the numbers are less or equal to 10, calculate the result for all numbers of the input.
Example:
1.	Input numbers are – 123, 456, 789, 1238, 856
2.	Input numbers are less than 10 – we calculate the result for all of numbers
3.	We select all numbers in even positions – 123, 789 and 856
4.	We find the product of all digits of 123– 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
5.	We find the product of all digits of 789 – 7 * 8 * 9 = 504
6.	We find the product of all digits of 856 – 8 * 5 * 6 = 240
7.	We find the product of all found products – 6 * 504 * 240 = 725760
