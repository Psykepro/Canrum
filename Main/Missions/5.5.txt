Look at this sad cat%. She and her cat friends have cat concert tommorow evening.% They need your help!
Each cat knows some songs (don’t ask what are their songs like… mostly mew mew mew mew…)
There are C cats (numbered from 1 to C) and S songs (numbered from 1 to S).%
You are given the songs each cat knows.%
They are very very lazy cats so help them to find the minimal number of songs that cats must sing in the concert so
 that every cat will sing at least one song. If no solution is available print “No concert!”. View the examples for clarification.
Input
The input data should be read from the console.%
On the first line there will be the string “C cats” where C is the number of cats.%
On the second line there will be the string “S songs” where S is the number of songs.%
On each of the next lines (except the last one) there will be a string in format “Cat X knows song Y” which means that 
cat with number X knows the song with number Y.%
On the last input line there will be the string “Mew!”
