I had a number (with distinct digits) written on a sheet of paper.
My cat (Sid) ate it (she loves to eat paper)!
Now I can only remember that some digits were before or after others. My memory is good and the order of digits I remember are always correct.
Please help me find the smallest possible number that corresponds to the digits order I remember.
The number was valid integer number with no leading zeroes.
There is always a possible solution.
Input
The input data should be read from the console.
On the first line there will be the number N.
On each of the next N lines there will be a string in the format “X is before Y” or “X is after Y”. X and Y will be valid digits (‘0’ – ‘9’).
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

1 is before 2
4 is after 2
3 is before 4
