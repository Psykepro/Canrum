We use the following 9 digits%
0	-!
1	**
2	!!!
3	&&
4	&-
5	!-
6	*!!!
7	&*!
8	!!**!-
We write the numbers as sequences digits from our 9 available digits given above.% The last digit of the number
 (the most right one) has a value as shown in the above table.% The next digit on the left has a value 9 times bigger
 than the shown in the above table, the next digit on the left has 9*9 times bigger value than the shown in the table
 and so on.% Your task is to write a program to convert a 9Gag-style number into its corresponding decimal representation.%
