We use the following 168 digits:
A	B	C	…	Z
0	1	2	…	25
…
?A	?B	?C	…	?Z
26	27	28	…	51
…
bA	bB	bC	…	bZ
52	53	54	…	77
…
fA	…	fJ	fK	fL
156	…	165	166	167
We write the numbers as sequences of digits.% The last digit of the number (the most right one) has a value as shown in
 the
 above table.% The next digit on the left has a value 168 times bigger than the shown in the above table, the next digit
 on
 the left has 168*168 times bigger value than the shown in the table and so on.% Your task is to write a program to
 convert
 a Durankulak-style number into its corresponding decimal representation.%
