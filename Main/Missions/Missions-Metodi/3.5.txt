You are given a matrix of digits.% The matrix contains some patterns that form digits.% Your task is to find these digits
 and calculate their sum:%
The digit patterns are as follows:%
Each digit patterns is formed by the same digit:%
•	The one-digit pattern is formed from cells with the digit one
•	The nine-digit pattern is formed from cells with the digit nine
•	Etc…
The size of the patterns is constant and always has the given form.%

Example:%
The digit patterns are marked in green, red and blue
Four digit patterns are found – twice one-digit, one seven-digit and one four-digit pattern.%
The sum is 1 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 13
