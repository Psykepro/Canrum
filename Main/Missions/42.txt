At long last scientist found out that the cats have an evil plan to enslave all of humanity. The sinister organization Al cat-qaeda have been targeting high profile programmers and taking them down (a.k.a brutally murdering them), because they are the only ones that can ruin their plans.
“But why programmers?” you would ask, because they are the only ones that can write a program to crack their communication codes. They are using a 23-based numeral system in order to fool everyone that they are stupid and harmless beings. The digits go as following:
a	b	c	d	…	j	k	…	w
0	1	2	3	…	9	10	…	22

Your task is to help the global programmer community. You will receive a set on letter-numbers (strings) on one line separated with a single space ‘ ‘. Sum all of the letter-numbers and print out the resulting sum both in the 23-based system and decimal system as shown in the examples.
% mia % mia = 6532
