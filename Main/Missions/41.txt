At long last scientist found out that the cats have an evil plan to enslave all of humanity. The sinister organization Al cat-qaeda have been targeting high profile programmers and taking them down (a.k.a brutally murdering them), because they are the only ones that can ruin their plans.
“But why programmers?” you would ask, because they are the only ones that can write a program to crack their communication codes. They are using a 21-based numeral system in order to fool everyone that they are stupid and harmless beings. The digits go as following:
a	b	c	d	…	j	k	…	u
0	1	2	3	…	9	10	…	20

Your task is to help the global programmer community. You will receive a set on letter-numbers (strings) on one line separated with a single space ‘ ‘. You have to decode every word transferring it from 21-based numeral system to 26-based numeral system (the whole English alphabet).
For example, if you have the word “cb” in decimal system that will be 2*21 + 1*1 = 43. That in 26-based system is 43 % 26 = 17 = ‘r’, 1 % 26 = 1 = ‘b’. So in 21-based “cb” is “br” in 26.based system.
